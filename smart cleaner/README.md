# SMART CLEANER 
This project is aimed at developing a practical and efficient smart vacuum cleaner for household use. The vacuum cleaner is controlled via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile application and utilizes a range of components such as an Arduino UNO microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, DC motors, and a fan to perform its cleaning tasks. The system is designed to navigate and clean floors, carpets, and collect dust efficiently.

# Key Features
- Bluetooth Control: The vacuum cleaner is operated through a mobile app that sends commands to the Arduino UNO via an HC-05 Bluetooth module.
- Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection: An ultrasonic sensor is employed to detect obstacles in the path of the cleaner. If an obstacle is detected, the fan is activated to suction it.
- Indicator LEDs: The system uses RGB LEDs to indicate the status of the device. Red LED indicates the system is powered on, yellow indicates the robot is in motion, and green indicates the fan is activated and working.
- Arduino UNO Microcontroller: The Arduino UNO controls the movement of the wheels, fan, and processes the data from the ultrasonic sensor.
- Efficient Operation: The vacuum cleaner operates on a power supply of 11.1V, providing enough power for the system to work effectively.
